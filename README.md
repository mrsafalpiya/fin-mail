A powerful email template manager and composer for Filament. Build, manage, and send emails directly from your admin panel — with dynamic token replacement, multilingual templates, customizable themes, template versioning, email logging with status tracking, auth email overrides, and a reusable Send Email action that drops into any resource.

## Features

- **Email Composer** — Send emails from any resource using templates as starting points, with full editing of subject, body, recipients, and attachments
- **Dynamic Templates** — No need for separate Mailable classes per template. One universal `TemplateMail` handles everything
- **Token Replacement** — `{{ user.name }}`, `{{ config.app.name }}`, conditionals `{% if user.is_premium %}`, and fallbacks `{{ user.name | 'Customer' }}`
- **Merge Tags** — Tokens are available as merge tags directly in the RichEditor toolbar for easy insertion
- **Recipient CSV Upload** — Compose a tokenised template by uploading a CSV of recipients and their token values; each row is sent as its own personalized email
- **Scheduled Sending** — Schedule a compose for a future time, then edit or cancel it from the Scheduled Emails screen right up until it fires
- **CTA Button Block** — Insert styled call-to-action buttons from the editor with configurable label, URL, and alignment
- **Template Versioning** — Automatic version history with preview and one-click restore
- **Email Logging** — Every sent email is logged with status tracking, rendered body storage, and polymorphic model association
- **Translatable** — Templates support multiple languages via `spatie/laravel-translatable`, all locales stored in a single record
- **Theme System** — Create color themes and apply them to templates, with live preview that updates as you change colors
- **Swappable Editor** — Ships with Filament's RichEditor by default, with Tiptap and TinyMCE supported via the `EditorContract`
- **Categories & Tags** — Organize templates as they grow
- **Reusable Actions** — `SendEmailAction` and `SentEmailsRelationManager` drop into any Filament resource
- **Preview & Test Send** — Preview templates inline and send test emails from the admin
- **Admin Settings** — Manage sender defaults, branding, logging, and attachment rules from the UI
- **Full Navigation Control** — Configure navigation groups, sort order, and visibility per resource from the plugin
- **Shield Support** — Built-in policies and permission setup for Filament Shield

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 11, 12, or 13
- Filament 4 or 5

FinMail uses [`spatie/laravel-settings`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-settings) to store plugin settings. It's pulled in automatically as a Composer dependency — `fin-mail:install` publishes and runs its migration if you don't already have a `settings` table.

## Installation

```bash
composer require finity-labs/fin-mail
```

> **Dependency conflict?** If you see an error about `phpdocumentor/type-resolver`, it means your project has `phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock` 6.x which conflicts with `spatie/laravel-settings`. Fix it by allowing Composer to resolve all dependencies:
> ```bash
> composer require finity-labs/fin-mail phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock:^5.6 -W
> ```

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:install
```

The install command will:
- Publish config and migrations
- Configure supported locales (auto-detects from your `lang/` directory)
- Optionally run migrations and seed default templates
- Optionally register the plugin in your Filament panel
- Optionally register FinMail styles in your custom Filament theme
- Optionally configure [Filament Shield](#filament-shield-integration) permissions
- Optionally configure scheduled cleanup of old sent emails

#### Non-interactive install

Pass `--locales` to skip the interactive locale prompt (useful for CI or scripted setups):

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:install --locales=en,hu,de --seed
```

During interactive install, choose **"Other"** from the locale list to manually enter any of the 59 supported locale codes.

### Custom Filament theme

If you are using a [custom Filament theme](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/panels/themes#creating-a-custom-theme), add the FinMail view path to your theme CSS so Tailwind can scan the plugin's styles:

```css
/* resources/css/filament/{panel}/theme.css */
@source '../../../../vendor/finity-labs/fin-mail/resources/views/**/*';
```

> The install command will do this automatically if it detects a custom theme CSS file for the selected panel.

### Register the plugin

```php
use FinityLabs\FinMail\FinMailPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            FinMailPlugin::make(),
        ]);
}
```

### Plugin options

```php
FinMailPlugin::make()
    ->enableSentEmails()    // Show the Sent Emails resource (default: true)
    ->enableThemes()        // Show the Themes resource (default: true)
    ->deleteActionOnEditPage() // Show delete button on edit pages (default: false)
    ->policyNamespace('App\\Policies') // Where Shield policies live (default: App\Policies)
```

### Navigation customization

All navigation group settings accept strings, enums, closures, or `null`:

```php
FinMailPlugin::make()
    // Set a shared navigation group for all resources and settings
    ->navigationGroup('Communications')

    // Or configure each resource independently
    ->emailTemplateNavigationGroup('Email')
    ->emailThemeNavigationGroup('Email')
    ->sentEmailNavigationGroup('Logs')
    ->settingsNavigationGroup('Administration')

    // Set sort order for all resources at once (auto-increments: base, +1, +2, +3)
    ->navigationSort(10)

    // Or configure each resource independently
    ->emailTemplateNavigationSort(10)
    ->emailThemeNavigationSort(20)
    ->sentEmailNavigationSort(30)
    ->settingsNavigationSort(40)
```

## Usage

### Sending emails programmatically

```php
use FinityLabs\FinMail\Mail\TemplateMail;

// Simple
Mail::to($user->email)->send(
    TemplateMail::make('welcome-email')
        ->models(['user' => $user])
);

// With locale, attachments, and overrides
Mail::to($customer->email)->send(
    TemplateMail::make('invoice-sent', locale: 'hu')
        ->models(['customer' => $customer, 'invoice' => $invoice])
        ->attachFile($invoice->getPdfPath(), "Invoice-{$invoice->number}.pdf")
);
```

`TemplateMail` is automatically queued. Configure the queue connection and name in `config/fin-mail.php`.

#### Passing extra view data

`models()` is for token replacement (`{{ user.name }}`). For variables you want available directly in the Blade template — without going through the token system — use `with()` or its `extraData()` alias:

```php
TemplateMail::make('order-confirmation')
    ->models(['user' => $user])
    ->with('trackingUrl', $tracking->url)
    // or pass an array:
    ->extraData([
        'orderItems' => $order->items,
        'currency' => 'EUR',
    ]);
```

After publishing the package views (`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=fin-mail-views`), the variables are available directly in the Blade template:

```blade
<a href="{{ $trackingUrl }}">Track your order</a>

@foreach ($orderItems as $item)
    {{ $item->name }} — {{ $item->price }} {{ $currency }}
@endforeach
```

The default keys (`body`, `preheader`, `theme`, `branding`) remain available — extra data is merged on top.

#### Using a custom email view

By default, FinMail renders emails using the built-in `fin-mail::email.default` view.

You can override the view on a per-email basis:

```php
TemplateMail::make('welcome-email')
    ->models(['user' => $user])
    ->overrideView('emails.custom-layout');
```

The custom view receives the same variables as the default view (`$body`, `$preheader`, `$theme`, `$branding`) as well as any data provided via `with()` or `extraData()`.

### Adding "Send Email" to any resource

```php
use FinityLabs\FinMail\Actions\SendEmailAction;

// In your table actions, header actions, or anywhere Filament actions are used
SendEmailAction::make()
    ->template('invoice-sent')
    ->recipient(fn (Invoice $record) => $record->customer->email)
    ->models(fn (Invoice $record) => [
        'invoice'  => $record,
        'customer' => $record->customer,
    ])
    ->attachments(fn (Invoice $record) => [
        ['path' => $record->getPdfPath(), 'name' => "Invoice-{$record->number}.pdf"],
    ])
    ->onSent(fn (Invoice $record) => $record->update(['emailed_at' => now()]))
```

A `SendEmailAction` (page header action) is also available with the same API.

### Showing sent emails on any resource

Add the `HasEmailTemplates` trait to your model:

```php
use FinityLabs\FinMail\Traits\HasEmailTemplates;

class Invoice extends Model
{
    use HasEmailTemplates;
}
```

Then add the relation manager to your resource:

```php
use FinityLabs\FinMail\Resources\RelationManagers\SentEmailsRelationManager;

public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        SentEmailsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

The trait provides helpers on your model:

```php
$invoice->sentEmails;                         // All sent emails
$invoice->latestSentEmail();                  // Most recent
$invoice->hasBeenEmailed('invoice-sent');     // Check if a specific template was sent
$invoice->sentEmailsCount();                  // Count
```

### Token syntax

| Syntax | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `{{ model.attr }}` | `{{ user.name }}` | Model attribute |
| `{{ model.rel.attr }}` | `{{ order.customer.name }}` | Nested relation |
| `{{ config.key }}` | `{{ config.app.name }}` | Config value |
| `{{ token \| 'fallback' }}` | `{{ user.name \| 'Customer' }}` | With fallback |
| `{% if token %}...{% endif %}` | `{% if user.is_premium %}...{% endif %}` | Conditional |
| `{% if token %}...{% else %}...{% endif %}` | | If/else |

### Merge tags

When editing a template, any tokens defined in the Tokens tab are available as merge tags in the RichEditor toolbar. Click the merge tags button to browse and insert them directly into the email body.

### Recipient CSV upload

A template that declares tokens in its Tokens tab cannot be composed against a typed recipient list — there would be nowhere to put each person's values. So when a template has at least one non-`config.*` token, the Compose Email screen replaces its To / Cc / Bcc fields with a **Recipient CSV** upload. Templates without tokens are unaffected and keep the normal recipient fields.

The file needs a header row with a column named `email`, plus one column per token:

```csv
email,user.name,invoice.total
alice@example.com,Alice,$120.00
bob@example.com,Bob,$40.00
```

Use **Download CSV template** on the compose screen to get this header row pre-filled, with an example row built from each token's documented example value.

Column headers are matched against the template's declared tokens (braces are optional — `{{ user.name }}` works too). A dotted token nests exactly as a model attribute would, so `user.name` resolves the same whether it came from a CSV or from `->models(['user' => $user])`. Columns matching no token — an `id` or `notes` column left over from a spreadsheet export — are ignored and reported rather than rejected.

On upload the file is parsed immediately and never written to disk. The summary reports how many recipients are ready, which tokens were mapped, and any warnings: ignored columns, rows skipped for a blank or invalid address, duplicate addresses (the first occurrence wins), and how many rows are missing a value for each token. **View recipients** shows the parsed table so you can check values landed on the right people before sending.

On send, **each row becomes its own email** with its own token values — the individual/combined choice does not apply. Scheduling works the same way: the parsed rows are stored with the schedule and expanded when `fin-mail:send-scheduled` fires.

A few details worth knowing:

- A blank cell falls back to the token's `| 'fallback'` if the body declares one, and otherwise renders as nothing. A recipient never receives a raw `{{ user.name }}` for a declared token.
- Values are HTML-escaped in the body, so `Smith & Sons` renders correctly and a CSV from an untrusted source cannot inject markup. The subject line receives the raw value.
- `config.*` tokens resolve on their own and are never asked for as a column.
- Delimiters (`,`, `;`, tab, `|`), a UTF-8 BOM, CRLF line endings, and quoted values are all handled.
- Row and file-size caps are configurable — see `fin-mail.csv` in the config.

### Scheduling emails

**Schedule Email** on the compose screen stores the composed email and sends it later. It takes the same individual-vs-combined delivery choice as an immediate send, plus a send time interpreted in the app timezone (`config('app.timezone')`); the time must be in the future. Delivery is done by `fin-mail:send-scheduled`, registered to run every minute, which claims each due row atomically before sending so an overlapping run can never send it twice.

The **Scheduled Emails** screen lists every schedule with its status — pending, sent, cancelled or failed — and offers two actions on a pending one:

- **Cancel** — the schedule will not be sent. Cancelling is final; a cancelled schedule cannot be re-armed.
- **Edit** — reopens the composer for that schedule.

Editing loads the composer filled from what was scheduled, not from the template, so a template edited after scheduling does not change an email already queued. Everything is editable: recipients, subject, preheader, body, attachments, locale, delivery mode and send time. **Update Schedule** rewrites the same row — it never creates a second schedule.

Two things worth knowing about editing:

- **Changing the locale reloads the subject, preheader and body from the template**, discarding your edits to them, exactly as it does when composing. That is how you pull in another language's content; it is also the one way to lose work on this screen.
- **A schedule can fire while you have it open.** The sender claims a due row before sending, and an edit that arrives after that is refused rather than written to a row whose content has already gone out. You are told so and returned to the list. Nothing is sent twice.

Edit is offered only for a pending schedule whose template still exists. Deleting a template leaves its schedules pointing at nothing — they cannot be edited, and will fail when their time comes, since delivery resolves the template by key.

For a tokenised template the schedule stores the parsed CSV rows, so the editor opens with those recipients already loaded and the upload field optional. Leave it empty to keep them; upload another file to replace the whole list.

### CTA Button block

The editor includes a built-in Button custom block. Click the custom blocks button (squares-plus icon) in the toolbar, select "Button", and configure:

- **Button Text** — The label displayed on the button
- **URL** — The link destination
- **Alignment** — Left, center, or right

The button automatically uses your theme's button colors (`button_bg` and `button_text`) in both preview and sent emails, with full inline styling for email client compatibility.

### Custom blocks

You can register your own custom blocks that work in the editor, preview, and sent emails. Each block must extend Filament's `RichContentCustomBlock`.

```php
FinMailPlugin::make()
    ->customBlocks([
        \App\Mail\Blocks\DividerBlock::class,
        \App\Mail\Blocks\FooterBlock::class,
    ]),
```

Registered blocks automatically appear in the editor's custom blocks toolbar, render in preview mode, and convert to HTML when emails are sent. ButtonBlock is always included by default.

Each custom block needs to implement:

- `getId()` — Unique identifier stored in the HTML
- `getLabel()` — Display name in the editor toolbar
- `configureEditorAction()` — Modal form for block settings
- `toPreviewHtml()` — HTML for the editor preview
- `toHtml()` — HTML for the actual sent email

If your block uses theme colors, add a static `setPreviewTheme(?array $theme)` method and it will receive theme updates automatically when the user changes the template theme.

## Events

FinMail dispatches events at key points in the email lifecycle so your application can react — e.g., log analytics, trigger webhooks, or update related models.

| Event | When | Payload |
|-------|------|---------|
| `EmailSending` | Before the email is sent | `SentEmail $sentEmail`, `?EmailTemplate $template` |
| `EmailSent` | After the email was sent successfully | `SentEmail $sentEmail`, `?EmailTemplate $template` |
| `EmailFailed` | When sending fails | `SentEmail $sentEmail`, `string $error`, `?EmailTemplate $template` |
| `TemplateUpdated` | When a template is saved (new version) | `EmailTemplate $template`, `int $newVersion` |

### Listening to events

```php
use FinityLabs\FinMail\Events\EmailSent;
use FinityLabs\FinMail\Events\EmailFailed;

// In a service provider or listener
Event::listen(EmailSent::class, function (EmailSent $event) {
    // $event->sentEmail — the SentEmail model
    // $event->template — the EmailTemplate used (nullable)
    logger()->info("Email sent to {$event->sentEmail->recipients_display}");
});

Event::listen(EmailFailed::class, function (EmailFailed $event) {
    // $event->error — the error message
    logger()->error("Email failed: {$event->error}");
});
```

All event properties are `readonly`. Events use `SerializesModels` so they are safe to dispatch from queued jobs.

## Filament Shield Integration

FinMail ships with built-in support for [Filament Shield](https://github.com/bezhanSalleh/filament-shield). Shield is entirely optional — without it, all resources are accessible to any authenticated user.

### Automatic setup

If Shield is installed, the `fin-mail:install` command will:
1. Register FinMail resources in your `filament-shield.php` config
2. Generate policies and permission entries via `shield:generate`

FinMail automatically maps Shield-generated policies (in `App\Policies` by default) to its models. If your policies live elsewhere, configure the namespace on the plugin:

```php
FinMailPlugin::make()
    ->policyNamespace('App\\Policies\\Admin')
```

### Manual setup

If you prefer to set up Shield manually, or if the automatic setup didn't complete:

```bash
php artisan shield:generate --panel=admin --option=policies_and_permissions
```

### Supported permissions

**Resources:**

| Resource | Permissions                                                                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Email Templates | `ViewAny`, `View`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Preview`, `SendTest`, `Compose` |
| Email Themes | `ViewAny`, `View`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`                                   |
| Sent Emails | `ViewAny`, `View`, `Resend`                                                       |

**Settings pages:**

Each settings page (General, Branding, Logging, Attachments, Auth Emails) has its own page-level permission managed by Shield.

### Cleanup on uninstall

The `fin-mail:uninstall` command automatically removes Shield config entries and permission records from the database.

## Auth Email Overrides

FinMail can replace the application's default authentication emails (verification, password reset) with your custom templates, and optionally send a welcome email on registration.

### Enable overrides

Navigate to **Settings → Auth Emails** in the admin panel and toggle the overrides you want.

### Required templates

Create templates with these keys (the seeder includes them by default):

| Template Key | Purpose | Available Tokens |
|---|---|---|
| `user-verify-email` | Email verification link | `{{ user.name }}`, `{{ user.email }}`, `{{ url }}` |
| `user-password-reset` | Password reset link | `{{ user.name }}`, `{{ user.email }}`, `{{ url }}` |
| `user-welcome` | Welcome email after registration | `{{ user.name }}`, `{{ user.email }}` |

### Locale support

Auth email overrides automatically use the active application locale (`app()->getLocale()`). If you use a language switcher plugin, the emails will be sent in the user's selected language — provided the template has a translation for that locale.

## Configuration

Publish the config:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=fin-mail-config
```

### Date formatting

By default, dates and datetimes throughout the plugin use Filament's built-in formatting. You can override this globally or per locale in `config/fin-mail.php`:

```php
// A single format for all locales
'date_format' => 'd/m/Y',
'datetime_format' => 'd/m/Y H:i',

// Or an array keyed by locale
'date_format' => [
    'en' => 'M d, Y',
    'de' => 'd.m.Y',
    'hu' => 'Y. m. d.',
],
'datetime_format' => [
    'en' => 'M d, Y H:i',
    'de' => 'd.m.Y H:i',
    'hu' => 'Y. m. d. H:i',
],
```

When set to `null` (or when the current locale isn't in the array), Filament's default formatting kicks in. These formats are standard PHP [date format characters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php).

You can also access the resolved format programmatically:

```php
use FinityLabs\FinMail\Facades\FinMail;

FinMail::dateFormat();     // string|null for current locale
FinMail::dateTimeFormat(); // string|null for current locale
```

### Recipient CSV limits

The compose screen is not a bulk mailer, so a CSV batch is capped:

```php
'csv' => [
    'max_rows' => 500,     // recipients a single send may expand into
    'max_size_kb' => 2048, // upload size limit
],
```

A file over either limit is rejected at upload with a message saying so.

Other publish tags:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `fin-mail-config` | Configuration file |
| `fin-mail-migrations` | Database migrations |
| `fin-mail-settings-migrations` | Spatie Settings migrations |
| `fin-mail-views` | Email template views |

## Upgrading

When upgrading from a previous version, run the upgrade command to apply any data migrations:

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:upgrade
```

This checks locked templates in the database against the latest seeder definitions and updates any that are outdated. The command is idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

Preview changes without applying them:

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:upgrade --dry-run
```

## Uninstalling

Run the uninstall command **before** removing the package:

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:uninstall
composer remove finity-labs/fin-mail
```

The uninstall command will:
- Remove `FinMailPlugin::make()` from your panel provider(s)
- Remove FinMail `@source` directive from custom Filament theme CSS files
- Remove FinMail entries from Shield config and clean up permissions from the database
- Optionally drop all FinMail database tables and settings entries
- Optionally delete published migrations, config, views, and translations
- Clear settings and application caches

## Testing
