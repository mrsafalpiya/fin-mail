## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Edit a scheduled email before it sends** — the Scheduled Emails table gains an **Edit** action beside **Cancel**, shown on a pending schedule whose template still exists. It reopens the composer filled from the stored payload rather than from the template, so an email already queued is unaffected by later template edits, and everything is editable: recipients, subject, preheader, body, attachments, locale, delivery mode and send time. **Update Schedule** rewrites the same row and never creates a second one. Saving is guarded against the sender: `fin-mail:send-scheduled` claims a due row before sending, and an edit that arrives after that is refused with a notification rather than written to a row whose content has already gone out. The original scheduler is preserved in **Scheduled by**, with the editor recorded alongside it. For a tokenised template the editor opens with the schedule's stored CSV rows already loaded and the upload optional — leave it empty to keep those recipients, or upload another file to replace them all. Changing the locale reloads the content from the template exactly as it does when composing, discarding edits to subject, preheader and body.
- **Recipient CSV upload for tokenised templates** — when a template declares tokens in its Tokens tab, the Compose Email screen replaces its To / Cc / Bcc fields with a **Recipient CSV** upload: one row per recipient, with a column per token. Each row is sent as its own personalized email, so the individual/combined choice no longer applies. The file is parsed on upload and never written to disk; the summary reports mapped tokens, ignored columns, skipped invalid rows, duplicate addresses and missing values, and **View recipients** shows the parsed table before sending. A **Download CSV template** button emits the required header row with example values. Blank cells fall back to the body's `| 'fallback'` and otherwise render as nothing, so a recipient can never receive a raw `{{ token }}`. Values are HTML-escaped in the body and raw in the subject. Scheduling stores the parsed rows and expands them identically when `fin-mail:send-scheduled` fires. Row and file-size caps live under `fin-mail.csv`. Templates without tokens are unaffected.
- **Schedule emails for later** — the Compose Email screen gains a **Schedule Email** action beside **Send Email**. It reuses the same multi-recipient / individual-vs-combined delivery choice and adds a future date-time picker (interpreted in the app timezone). Scheduled emails are stored in a new `scheduled_emails` table and delivered by the `fin-mail:send-scheduled` command, which runs every minute and atomically claims each due row so it can never be sent twice. A new **Scheduled Emails** resource lists pending/sent/cancelled/failed schedules and lets you cancel a pending one before it fires.
- **Paste multiple recipients at once** — the To / Cc / Bcc fields on the Compose Email screen now split pasted text into individual address tags on commas and newlines, so a comma-separated list or a column of addresses copied from a spreadsheet lands as separate, individually validated entries instead of a single tag. Typing a comma still commits a tag as before.

### Fixed

- Tokens in a subject line composed on the Compose Email screen were delivered literally as `{{ user.name }}`. `TemplateMail` now runs token replacement over an overridden subject, as it already did for the body.
- The **Preheader** field on the Compose Email screen was silently discarded — the template's stored preheader was sent instead. `TemplateMail` gained `overridePreheader()` and `EmailSender` now passes the composed value through, with token replacement.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **App-relative logo resolution** — branding logos configured as relative paths (e.g. `/images/logo.png`) are now resolved to absolute URLs at render time via `BrandingSettings::resolvedLogo()`, so they display in email clients. Absolute URLs, protocol-relative URLs, and data URIs pass through unchanged (#19, thanks @mrsafalpiya)

### Fixed

- Button and other custom blocks were replaced with plain text when a template was loaded into the Compose Email editor, and were missing from the sent email. `EmailTemplate::render()` gained a `renderBlocks` flag so blocks round-trip in the editor, and `TemplateMail` now expands blocks in overridden bodies (#17, thanks @mrsafalpiya)
- Templates without an assigned theme now fall back to the user-configured default theme instead of the package's hardcoded colors — in the preview, the body infolist, and the sent email. New helpers: `EmailTheme::resolvedDefaultColors()` and `EmailTemplate::resolvedThemeColors()` (#18, thanks @mrsafalpiya)
- Theme colors stored as `null` or an empty string (cleared ColorPickers) no longer override the hardcoded defaults when resolving colors

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- `Undefined array key "cleanup_frequency"` when saving the Logging settings with *Enable Schedule Cleanup* turned off. The frequency field is hidden in that state, so it isn't submitted — the save mutation now casts it only when it's present and leaves the stored value untouched otherwise (#16, thanks @Wijnands)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Per-email view override** — New `overrideView()` method on `TemplateMail` renders an email with your own Blade layout instead of the package's `fin-mail::email.default`, while keeping database-driven templates, token replacement, theming, logging, and attachments. The custom view receives the same variables as the default one (`$body`, `$preheader`, `$theme`, `$branding`) plus anything passed via `with()` or `extraData()`. Existing emails are unaffected if you don't call it (#14, thanks @agencetwogether)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- `MissingSettings` exception during artisan boot when scheduled cleanup is registered before the `fin-mail-logging` settings have been migrated. The catch around `app(LoggingSettings::class)` didn't cover the lazy property access that actually triggers the load, so the exception escaped and broke `package:discover` and `fin-mail:install` in some setups (#13, thanks @devrizzz)

### Notes

- `spatie/laravel-settings` is now mentioned explicitly in the README as an auto-installed dependency

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Permission gating for custom actions** — `Preview`, `SendTest`, `Compose` (Email Templates) and `Resend` (Sent Emails) are now hidden from the UI when Filament Shield is installed and the authenticated user lacks the corresponding permission. Falls back to the previous always-visible behavior when Shield is absent, so existing installs are unaffected (#12, thanks @agencetwogether)
- `FinMailPlugin::isShieldAvailable()` helper for checking Shield presence
- `preview_heading` translation key for the preview modal header, populated across all 58 supported locales

### Changed

- `InstallCommand` now seeds `preview`, `sendTest`, `compose`, and `resend` into the Filament Shield config so `shield:generate` produces the matching policy methods and permissions
- Bulk delete on the Email Templates table now uses `authorizeIndividualRecords('delete')` when Shield is active

### Notes

- After upgrading on a Shield-enabled install, run `php artisan shield:generate --panel=admin --option=policies_and_permissions` to register the new permissions

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Pass extra view data to email templates** — New `extraData()` method (and native `with()` support) on `TemplateMail` for passing variables directly to the Blade view, separate from the token replacement system. Useful for view-only data that doesn't need to flow through the token engine (#10, thanks @agencetwogether)

### Fixed

- Reply-To section was missing from the email template infolist (view page). It's now displayed alongside the Custom Sender section (#11, thanks @agencetwogether)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Reply-To support for templates** — Each template can now have its own reply-to address and name, configurable from the template settings tab. Falls back to `null` if not set, so existing templates are unaffected. The `TemplateMail` mailable also gains an `overrideReplyTo()` setter for runtime overrides (#9, thanks @agencetwogether)
- Reply-to translations added to all 58 supported locales

### Notes

- A new migration is included (`add_reply_to_on_email_templates_table`). Run `php artisan migrate` after upgrading.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- Migrations now use configured table names from `fin-mail.php` config instead of hardcoded defaults, fixing issues with foreign key references when table names are customized (#7, thanks @agencetwogether)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Custom block registration** — Register your own editor blocks via `FinMailPlugin::make()->customBlocks([...])`. Custom blocks now render correctly in the editor, preview mode, and sent emails. ButtonBlock is always included by default. Closes #6

### Changed

- Block rendering in `EmailTemplate`, `TipTapConverter`, and `DefaultEditor` now reads from a dynamic plugin-level registry instead of a hardcoded list

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Configurable date formatting** — New `date_format` and `datetime_format` config options, supporting a single string or a per-locale array. When null, Filament's defaults apply. Includes `FinMail::dateFormat()` and `FinMail::dateTimeFormat()` facade helpers
- **Token fields in test email modal** — Send test email modal now shows input fields for documented tokens (excluding `config.*` and `user.*`), pre-filled with example values from the token schema
- **Full rendered body storage** — Sent emails now store the complete HTML as actually delivered (layout, theme, branding, footer), not just the inner body content
- **Sent email infolist** — Sent email preview replaced with a proper Filament infolist using `TextEntry`, `ViewEntry`, and badge components
- **Laravel 13 support**
- **`@property` annotations on SentEmail model** for PHPStan

### Fixed

- Test emails sent from the template list now go through `EmailSender`, so they appear in the sent emails log
- Sent email preview now renders with full styling via base64 iframe, matching what was actually delivered
- Missing translations for `versioning.preview`, `sent.preview.*`, `settings.sections.add_additional_senders`, and `settings.sections.add_footer_links` across all 58 non-en/fr languages

### Changed

- All date/datetime displays across the plugin now use the configured format from `config/fin-mail.php`
- Sent email relation manager preview uses the shared `SentEmailInfolist` schema instead of a blade view
- Screenshots section in README uses collapsible `<details>` tags

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Version History UI** — Version history now displays in a proper Filament table with per-row preview and restore actions
- **Version Preview** — Preview any version's email content directly from the version history modal
- **Version Restore** — Restore any previous version with one click; current content is automatically saved as a new version first
- **Upgrade Command** — New `php artisan fin-mail:upgrade` command to migrate existing data after package updates (supports `--dry-run`)

### Fixed

- **Versioning not working** — Version cleanup query was deleting all versions instead of keeping the most recent ones
- **Version history crash** — Subject column was passed as an array to `Str::limit()`, causing a TypeError
- **Seeded template buttons stripped by editor** — Inline-styled `<a>` tags in seeded templates (Password Reset, Verify Email) were stripped by TipTap due to `font-weight: 600` conflicting with the link mark; buttons now use the native `customBlock` format
- **Custom blocks not rendered in previews** — Button blocks stored as `<div data-type="customBlock">` were not converted to visible HTML in the View page preview and Compose page preview
- **Button preview ignores theme colors** — Button block preview in the RichEditor now reflects the selected template theme instead of hardcoded colors; updates live when changing the theme dropdown

### Changed

- **Translations** — Added `blocks` and `versioning` translation keys for all 59 supported languages
- Button block default label and preview label now use translation keys instead of hardcoded English
- `renderCustomBlocks()` is now public for use by preview components
- Versions relationship eager-loads `createdBy` to prevent lazy loading violations

### Upgrading from 1.1.0

If you have existing seeded templates with buttons (Password Reset, Verify Email), run the upgrade command to convert them to the new format:

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:upgrade
```

You can preview what would change first with `--dry-run`:

```bash
php artisan fin-mail:upgrade --dry-run
```

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **CTA Button Block** — New custom block for inserting styled call-to-action buttons with configurable label, URL, and alignment, themed automatically
- **Inline Link Styling** — Links in email body now receive inline theme colors for email clients that strip `<style>` blocks
- **Live Theme Preview** — Color changes in the theme editor update the preview immediately without saving
- **Custom Theme Auto-Registration** — Install command detects custom Filament theme CSS and registers FinMail styles; uninstall cleans up

### Fixed

- Email preview now shows current form content and selected theme instead of last saved state
- TipTap merge tag nodes properly converted to `{{ token }}` text in preview and sent emails
- Token replacement now works on compose page emails (override body)

- Uninstall command handles fluent plugin configuration
- Portuguese translations

### Changed

- Compose page defaults "To" field to logged-in user's email
